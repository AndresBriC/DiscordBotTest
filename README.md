# DiscordBotTest
First test for making a discord bot

This is a personal project where I tried to make a mostly for fun Discord bot for my friend's server.

Some of the features it has are:
- Keeping track of the last pearson to leave during a call session. With the leaderboard being stored and update from this repo in a CSV.
- Creating poll with up to 10 options.
- A utility to slice a gene sequence starting from the first ATG, and stopping with the first TAG, TAA or TGA found. It need to be scraped from a justpaste.it url. It returns a txt file with the silced gene. Usage example: $geneslice https://justpaste.it/2jvg9 .
- Other fun/dumb stuff like an 8Ball, a spam ping command and making a text pyramid with a given string.

The bot is currently being hosted in Heroku using a free dyno.
